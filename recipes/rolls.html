<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
    <li>½ ounces RapidRise Yeast</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Oil</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large mixer bowl. Heat water, oil and 2 tablespoons butter until very warm (120 to 130 degrees F). Add to flour mixture. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. Stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 7 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide dough into 12 equal pieces; shape into balls. Place in a greased 10-inch iron skillet. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and brush over rolls.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated 375 degrees F oven for 18 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pan; brush with any remaining butter, if desired. Serve warm.</li>
