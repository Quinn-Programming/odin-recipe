        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Form ground beef into 4 equal burgers.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add burgers and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Season burgers with 1/2 of the salt and 1/2 of the pepper, flip, and cook for 6 minutes. Season with remaining salt and pepper, flip, and cook for another 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 of the Worcestershire sauce onto the burgers, flip, and cook for 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining sauce and cook, about 2 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
